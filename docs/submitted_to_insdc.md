# Type: submitted_to_insdc


"Depending on the study (large-scale e.g. done with next generation sequencing technology, or small-scale) sequences have to be submitted to SRA (Sequence Read Archive), DRA (DDBJ Read Archive) or via the classical Webin/Sequin systems to Genbank, ENA and DDBJ. Although this field is mandatory, it is meant as a self-test field, therefore it is not necessary to include this field in contextual data submitted to databases"
