            "description": "Using analytical expertise at both the JGI and EMSL, we plan to follow successional patterns of protein expression by root-associated microorganisms. This work builds on foundational research we are conducting with the common California grassland plant, Avena fatua, grown in Hopland, CA soil (FOA DE-PS02-09ER09-25). Using our 16-chamber 13C labeling facility at UC Berkeley, we have shown that elevated CO2 increased the amount of C allocated belowground, and increased the yield of root biomass. The rhizosphere microbial community undergoes a succession as the root grows, senesces, and dies. In elevated CO2 treatments, we also detect a greater amount of root-derived 13C in the mineral-associated heavy fraction of the soil, which is commonly assumed to reflect longer term stabilization. \\n \\nIn our JGI-EMSL project, we will follow over time how roots impact the functional capacity of the rhizosphere microbiome to enzymatically mediate decomposition processes. We hypothesize that root-exudate stimulation of soil microbial populations results in elevated expression of biomolecules (transcripts, enzymes, metabolites) for the decomposition of macromolecular C compounds.",
