  functional annotation:
    description: >-
      An assignment of a function term (e.g. reaction or pathway) that is executed by a gene product, or which the gene product plays an active role in.
      Functional annotations can be assigned manually by curators, or automatically in workflows. In the context of NMDC, all function annotation is performed
      automatically, typically using HMM or Blast type methods

    comments:
      - "For features that cross the origin of a circular feature (e.g. most bacterial genomes, plasmids, and some viral genomes), the requirement for start to be less than or equal to end is satisfied by making end = the position of the end + the length of the landmark feature."
