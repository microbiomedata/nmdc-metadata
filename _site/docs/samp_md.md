# Type: samp_md


"In non deviated well, measured depth is equal to the true vertical depth, TVD (TVD=TVDSS plus the reference or datum it refers to). In deviated wells, the MD is the length of trajectory of the borehole measured from the same reference or datum. Common datums used are ground level (GL), drilling rig floor (DF), rotary table (RT), kelly bushing (KB) and mean sea level (MSL). If ""other"" is specified, please propose entry in ""additional info"" field                             "
