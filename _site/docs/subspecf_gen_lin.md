# Type: subspecf_gen_lin


"This should provide further information about the genetic distinctness of the sequenced organism by recording additional information e.g. serovar, serotype, biotype, ecotype, or any relevant genetic typing schemes like Group I plasmid. It can also contain alternative taxonomic information. It should contain both the lineage name, and the lineage rank, i.e. biovar:abc123"
