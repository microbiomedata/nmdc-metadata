The project uses venv to create a virtural enironment.  
To create a virtual environment run the command `python3 -m venv <environment name>`  .  
I typically name my environment `.env`, and configure `.gitignore` to ignore `.env` files. This prevents the environment libraries from being uploaded to the repository.  

After the environment is created, run the command `source <environment name>/bin/activate` to enter the environment.  
Once in the environment, use `pip` to install libraries (e.g., `pip install pandas`). Once all the libraries have been installed you can export a list of them using the `pip freeze` command. Typically, the list is saved to a file named `requirements.txt`.  
e.g., `pip freeze > requirements.txt`  

To load a list of dependencies, use the `pip install -r` command.  
e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You exit the environment by executing the command `deactivate` in the terminal.
