  Schema for National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC).
  This schem is organized into 3 separate modules:
    
  * a set of core types for representing data values
  * the mixs schema (auto-translated from mixs excel)
  * the NMDC schema itself

  database:
    aliases:
      - "NMDC metadata object"
    description: >-
      An abstract holder for any set of metadata and data. It does not need to correspond to an actual managed databse
      top level holder class. When translated to JSON-Schema this is the 'root' object.
      It should contain pointers to other objects of interest
    slots:
      - biosample set
      - study set
      - data object set
      - activity set
  
  data object:
    is_a: named thing
    description: >-
      An object that primarily consists of symbols that represent information.  
      Files, records, and omics data are examples of data objects.

  biosample:
    is_a: named thing
    aliases: ['sample', 'material sample']
    description: >-
      A material sample. It may be environmental (encompassing many organisms) or isolate or tissue.  
      An environmental sample containing genetic material from multiple individuals is commonly referred to as a biosample.
